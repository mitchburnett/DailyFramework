## Setting up your local test enviornment

The following is a tutorial to set up your own local test enviornment to
develop and test DailyFramework code. These instructions are assuming an
ï£¿ enviornment, can be easily abstracted to a unix-like enviornment.

1. Install the node js server runtime and mongodb. My preferred method is to
use a package manager like brew. To get brew you can run the following command
in the terminal
```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```.
Afterwards node and mongo are easily installed with
```brew install node``` and ```brew install mongodb```.
